Gen Sir Robert Cassels, the commander-in-chief of the\\nIndian Armed forces, ordered the raising of an Airborne Cadre in October\\n1940. The initial battalions consisted of the 50th Parachute Brigade raised\\nat Delhi Cantonment in 1941 with Brig W.H.G. Gough as the first\\nCommander. The first Indian officer to join the Parachute Brigade was Lt\\nRangaraj, the medical officer of the 15th battalion of the 50th Parachute\\nBrigade. The Indian Parachute regiment was raised on 1 March 1945 with\\nLt Gen Frederick (Boy) Browning as the colonel of the regiment. The\\nregimental insignia was that of its counterpart in the British Army, which\\nwas worn on a maroon beret. After the Second World War the Indian\\nParachute regiment was disbanded in 1945 and placed under the 2nd\\nairborne division consisting of three parachute brigades, i.e., the 50th, 77th\\nand 14th airlanding brigades, as part of the demobilization of much of the\\nIndian Army.

tales of unimaginable bravery against all odds sets the SF a\\nclass apart. While I was putting this collection of stories together, words\\noften fell short. The legacy of this league of warriors, the righteous owners\\nof the title of ‘Balidan’—the Indian Para (SF)—is shrouded in mystery and\\nis the stuff of legends. Why do I say this? Because if you try to reach out to\\none of these men, you’ll discover that behind their popular names in public\\n—the Fourth of North, Ghosts, Vipers, Red Devils, Predators, Desert\\nScorpios—they don’t really exist.\\nWriting this book has been a kind of spiritual awakening for me,\\nopening doors of self-realization that eventually led to much self-\\nimprovement in my life. Sitting with these passionate young men, who have\\nachieved and done so much for our nation, listening to their stories in their\\nown words—it has changed me as a person. I started writing Balidan\\n in\\nJanuary 2021 and finished in January 2023. What an incredible journey it\\nhas been!\\nI was privileged to witness these men jumping from their aircraft and\\ncombat-diving in real time.

Yet, it is not\\nmerely their training or skill behind enemy lines that makes these men stand\\nout in a crowd.

In the era of modern\\ntechnology, information hybrid warfare and global threats, when the world\\nis going through changes, it is important we provide our next generations\\nwith national icons of heroism to inculcate feelings of patriotism and instil\\nconfidence in our nation’s abilities.\\nThese men can be compared to Greek mythological heroes like\\nHercules, Achilles or Odysseus. They often enjoying a cult following\\namong men. Fervour and utter professionalism have been the trademarks of\\nthese extraordinary men while they uphold the zenith of valour and\\nsteadfast devotion to duty, making hundreds of sacrifices along the way.\\nI would like to mention that while the professional achievements of\\nthese men are spectacular, their off-duty escapades are also most colourful.\\nWe must not forget that we are talking about rebels from the Armed Forces,\\nthe antithesis to military culture and discipline.\\nTheir romances are the stuff of legendary love stories, and when they\\nfight, battles are born!

And the tunnel has the singular honour of being the first\\nvertical wind tunnel in India. I made a mental note on how his passion for\\nhis job had pushed him to achieve many firsts, from Mount Everest\\nexpeditions and techniques of skydiving to a whole infrastructural facility.\\nThis man is a superstar. And like most superstars, his life is not untouched\\nby controversy.\\nI asked his wife, Renuka Rathore, about the controversy he had faced in\\nthe past.\\n 52\\n She laughed it off, saying, ‘When he was dragged into an\\nunnecessary controversy where he had no role to play, he was hurt, but I\\nasked him, “Why are you so upset? What is the maximum that can happen?\\nThat you will retire as a colonel? That’s it.” He told me he was not bitter\\nabout his rank. It truly does not matter to him. He said, “I am a soldier, I\\nonly want active soldiering. And I need peace to focus on my job. People’s\\nunnecessary speculations trouble me more.”’\\nI also had a word with Lt Gen A.K. Singh (retd), ex-Southern\\nCommander and the former Lieutenant Governor of Andaman and Nicobar\\nIslands and Puducherry. He has known Brig Saurabh Singh Shekhawat for\\nmany years. He told me, ‘Saurabh is a man with true soldierly attributes.\\nHis men would follow him anywhere only because he puts himself in\\nharm’s way first. Anyway, I would want my battlefield subordinates to be\\nlike him. He exhibits excellent abilities and agility during any task. He is\\ndaring and courageous, but at the same time, he is responsible and calm.\\nThis shows how he has found his balance. Tell me, what kind of person\\nwould climb Mount Everest thrice! It is only a man with the utmost\\ndetermination and skill and also a man who is not reckless who would do\\nthis. If you see, in Loktak, he trained for forty-five days along with his men\\n—that kind of patience is rare, I tell you. If a person with his credentials\\ndoes not make it to the next rank, then who would? The Army has a very\\nfair and transparent system of rectifying itself.

He then briefed the\\nteam to make their entry from both sides of the establishment to confuse the\\nterrorists about their exact movements.

Notably, the Tutorials section lists guides to build chatbots with\\nmemory and agents calling tools\\n. Key topics like memory, tools, and multi-step retrieval are\\ncovered in conceptual guides and examples. LangChain’s Academy and the official LangSmith docs\\nalso provide structured learning paths on agent observability and deployment. For background on\\nLangChain fundamentals (chains, prompts, memory, etc.), introductory tutorials and conceptual\\nguides are listed on the LangChain docs site\\n.\\nDocumentation and Official Guides\\nNext.js: The official Next.js docs describe Next.js as a React framework for building full-stack web\\napps\\n. It includes guides on TypeScript, API routes, and deployment (including Vercel). The docs\\nhave sections on “Getting Started” and various guides (Pages vs App Router, routing, data fetching).\\nThe Next.js Docs explicitly invite community support via GitHub Discussions, Discord, Twitter, and\\nReddit\\n. Refer to the Next.js docs for best practices (e.g. API routes for BFF, next.config.js\\nrewrites) and tutorials on SSR/SSG, React hooks, etc. \\nFastAPI: FastAPI’s official documentation calls it “a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework\\nfor  building  APIs  with  Python”\\n.  It  has  an  extensive  user  guide  with  examples  on  routers,\\ndependencies,  OAuth2,  error  handling,  WebSockets,  and  streaming  responses  (e.g.  Server-Sent\\nEvents). The “Full Stack FastAPI Template” docs outline a sample stack (FastAPI + React/TypeScript\\n+ Docker + Postgres + Auth)\\n. The FastAPI docs also highlight community resources: an official\\nDiscord chat for discussion and  GitHub Discussions for Q&A\\n. Use the docs for reference on\\nPydantic models, async/await use, and built-in OpenAPI support. \\n• \\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n• \\n6\\n7\\n6\\n• \\n8\\n9\\n• \\n10\\n11\\n12\\n1'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'WeasyPrint 65.1', 'creator': 'ChatGPT', 'creationdate': '', 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf_files\\\\Comprehensive Resources for Next.js + FastAPI + LangChain Agent Stack.pdf', 'file_path': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf_files\\\\Comprehensive Resources for Next.js + FastAPI + LangChain Agent Stack.pdf', 'total_pages': 6, 'format': 'PDF 1.7', 'title': 'Comprehensive Resources for Next.js + FastAPI + LangChain Agent Stack', 'author': 'ChatGPT Deep Research', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': '', 'creationDate': '', 'page': 1}, page_content='LangChain  and  LangGraph: The  LangChain  docs  site  provides  a  comprehensive  reference  for\\nchains, agents, tools, and memory.

LangGraph (LangChain’s agent/memory framework) is covered under\\n“Orchestration” tutorials (e.g. building agents with memory or tools). The docs list include “Agents”\\nand “Chatbots” tutorials. Also check the LangChain forum and the Slack community (see Community\\nsection below) for clarifications. \\nExample Projects and Code Repositories\\nNext.js + FastAPI Starter: The “Next.js + FastAPI: Chat with Your Website” repo is a template\\ncombining these technologies with LangChain tools\\n. It integrates a FastAPI backend as a Next.js\\nAPI route (using next.config.js  rewrites) so that locally FastAPI runs on localhost:8000  and\\nin production on Vercel serverless\\n. This repo demonstrates fetching and processing website\\ncontent via LangChain and streaming answers back to the Next.js front-end. \\nCopilotKit/LangGraph Demos: CopilotKit’s example  open-gemini-canvas repo shows a production-\\nlike stack: Next.js frontend, FastAPI backend, and LangGraph-based agents powered by Google\\nGemini/LLMs\\n.  It  includes  two  agents  (a  post-generator  and  a  stack-analyzer)  and  uses\\nenvironment variables for API keys. This project illustrates a clean separation of Next.js (UI) and\\nFastAPI (agents)\\n. \\nAssistant-UI + LangGraph: The assistant-ui-langgraph-fastapi  repo uses LangGraph with\\na modern React-based chat UI. It runs a LangGraph agent on FastAPI, streaming responses via\\nassistant-stream, and uses  assistant-ui  in Next.js for a sleek chat interface\\n. Features\\ninclude real-time streaming to the browser and integration of external tools/APIs. Studying this code\\nshows how to set up a streaming SSE endpoint in FastAPI and hook it into a Next.js front-end\\n.\\nAgentKit (BCG X): AgentKit is an open-source LangChain-based starter kit for scalable agent apps. It\\nuses Next.js 14 (with Tailwind, TypeScript, NextAuth) and FastAPI (with SQLModel, Pydantic 2.x) in a\\nDocker-compose setup\\n. AgentKit provides a chat UI with streaming, table/code rendering, and\\nincludes  readiness  for  auth,  Redis/Celery  queues,  and  monitoring\\n.  It  exemplifies  a\\nproduction-ready architecture (with container deployment and tests) for LLM agents. \\nStreaming Demo (LangChain + FastAPI): The LangChain-FastAPI-Streaming  repo by Coding-\\nCrashkurse  demonstrates  streaming  chat  with  GPT-3.5  and  FastAPI\\n.  It  shows  how  to  use\\nLangChain’s async astream  interface with FastAPI’s StreamingResponse  to send chunked LLM\\noutputs to a browser in real time\\n. This is useful for learning how to implement SSE or chunked\\nresponses for live chat. \\nFull RAG Example (React + FastAPI): The “LangChain-RAG-Pattern” demo by jonathanscholtes is a\\ncomplete project using a React frontend and FastAPI backend with an Azure Cosmos DB vector store\\n. It walks through indexing data, spinning up FastAPI endpoints for retrieval, and building a\\nReact UI to ask grounded questions. This shows how to structure a Retrieval-Augmented Generation\\napp across the full stack\\n.\\n• \\n6\\n• \\n13\\n13\\n• \\n2\\n2\\n• \\n14\\n14\\n• \\n15\\n16\\n15\\n• \\n17\\n17\\n• \\n18\\n18\\n2'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'WeasyPrint 65.1', 'creator': 'ChatGPT', 'creationdate': '', 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf_files\\\\Comprehensive Resources for Next.js + FastAPI + LangChain Agent Stack.pdf', 'file_path': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf_files\\\\Comprehensive Resources for Next.js + FastAPI + LangChain Agent Stack.pdf', 'total_pages': 6, 'format': 'PDF 1.7', 'title': 'Comprehensive Resources for Next.js + FastAPI + LangChain Agent Stack', 'author': 'ChatGPT Deep Research', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': '', 'creationDate': '', 'page': 2}, page_content='Other Boilerplates: There are also boilerplate templates (e.g. Next.js + FastAPI + LangChain CLI) and\\ncommunity starter projects. For example, a Next.js + FastAPI “enterprise” template was extended\\nwith LangChain by UF-Hobi (see their GitHub). Searching GitHub for “FastAPI LangChain” or “Next.js\\nLangChain” yields community projects and demo apps to study.\\nVideo Tutorials and Conference Talks\\nYouTube Channels: Many developers share free tutorials. Look for “LangChain agents” or “FastAPI\\nstreaming” on YouTube. Channels by CodewithAI, Dave Gray, or AI-focused educators often cover\\nNext.js + LangChain apps. For example, Dave Gray has a video “Build an AI RAG App with LangChain\\n& Next.js” (covering chat UI and vector DB). FreeCodeCamp or TechWithTim may have full-stack\\nFastAPI/Next.js walkthroughs (though maybe without LangChain specifics). \\nStreaming and Integration Walkthroughs: There  are  video series on  LangChain that include\\nstreaming to the web (e.g. “LangChain JS Tutorial #3: Response Streaming with Next.js 13”). Likewise,\\nlook  for  tutorials  on  “FastAPI  LangChain  streaming”  –  some  creators  demonstrate  SSE  with\\nLangChain in FastAPI.\\nLangChain Conferences: LangChain’s Interrupt AI Agent Conference (May 2025) has many recorded\\nsessions. For instance, the LangChain website lists the 2025 recordings: it includes a “LangChain\\nKeynote”, “LangChain: Building Reliable Agents”, an “Andrew Ng: State of Agents” talk, and other\\nindustry sessions\\n. These sessions (available on the LangChain site and YouTube) cover agent\\ndesign, LangGraph, and production-scale deployment patterns. Watching these can give high-level\\ninsights into building robust agentic systems\\n.\\nBooks and Articles\\n“Learning  LangChain”  (O’Reilly): This  comprehensive  book  covers  everything  from  LangChain\\nbasics to advanced agents. It includes chapters on building RAG pipelines, adding memory with\\nLangGraph,  and  deploying  agents\\n.  It  explicitly  promises  a  step-by-step  guide  to  “build  a\\nproduction-ready  AI  agent”  using  LangChain\\n.  It’s  a  recommended  in-depth  reference  for\\nLangChain users. \\nAgent Development Books: Other recommended reads include “Hands-On GenAI Agent Development\\nwith  LangChain” and  “AI  Agents  and  Applications” (Manning),  which  delve  into  multi-agent\\narchitectures and tooling. These aren’t free, but they cover theoretical and practical aspects of\\nagents. \\nTutorial Articles: Many blogs and Medium posts cover aspects of this stack. Besides the ones cited\\nabove, look for articles on  building a chatbot with LangChain,  LLM retrieval systems, and  Next.js +\\nPython APIs. For example, dev.to, Medium, and Hacker Noon often have case studies (like converting\\nLLM outputs to streaming JSON, or using conversational memory). Curating bookmarks from these\\ncan help fill knowledge gaps.\\n• \\n• \\n• \\n• \\n19\\n19\\n• \\n20\\n20\\n• \\n• \\n3'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'WeasyPrint 65.1', 'creator': 'ChatGPT', 'creationdate': '', 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf_files\\\\Comprehensive Resources for Next.js + FastAPI + LangChain Agent Stack.pdf', 'file_path': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf_files\\\\Comprehensive Resources for Next.js + FastAPI + LangChain Agent Stack.pdf', 'total_pages': 6, 'format': 'PDF 1.7', 'title': 'Comprehensive Resources for Next.js + FastAPI + LangChain Agent Stack', 'author': 'ChatGPT Deep Research', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': '', 'creationDate': '', 'page': 3}, page_content='Community and Support\\nLangChain  Community: Join  the  official  LangChain  Slack  and  forum  for  help  and  discussion.\\nLangChain’s website invites users to their community Slack (for design discussions) and points to the\\nLangChain Forum for product support\\n.

Subreddits  like  r/nextjs  and  r/FastAPI  are  good  places  to  ask\\nquestions  or  find  shared  projects.  For  example,  a  post  on  r/FastAPI  shares  a  starter  project\\ncombining Next.js and LangChain\\n. Likewise, r/LangChain (if existing) or general ML/AI forums on\\nReddit can offer advice.\\nOther  Resources: Consider  joining  relevant  Discord/Slack  groups  for  React,  Python,  and  LLM\\nenthusiasts. Community-contributed templates (e.g. on GitHub) often have useful discussions in\\ntheir  issue  trackers.  Engaging  with  communities  (StackOverflow,  GitHub  Discussions,  r/AI  or  r/\\nMachineLearning) can help solve specific integration issues (e.g. state management or deployment\\nquirks).\\nKey Use-Case References\\nConversational Agents with Memory: LangChain’s chatbot tutorial (using LangGraph) teaches\\nadding conversation memory to an assistant\\n. The LangChain Academy course “Deep Agents with\\nLangGraph” specifically focuses on long-term agent memory\\n. Studying these shows how to store\\nconversation history (via BaseChatMessageHistory or StateGraph) and use it to maintain context.\\nAgents Calling APIs/DBs: For agents that invoke external tools or APIs, see the LangChain “Build an\\nAgent” tutorial (agents with tool functions)\\n. The AgentKit repo includes a library of common API\\ntools  ready  to  plug  in\\n.  The  assistant-ui-langgraph-fastapi  example  also  hints  at\\nintegrating custom tools (it mentions “integrate external tools and APIs”\\n). Practically, you’d write\\nLangChain tools (Python functions or API wrappers) and attach them to agents.\\nReal-Time Streaming Chat: Use FastAPI’s async streaming (via SSE or WebSockets) to push tokens\\nto  the  frontend.  The  dev.to  article  shows  using  StreamingResponse  and  LangChain’s\\nastream_log  for SSE\\n. The Crashkurse demo likewise streams chunks from OpenAI’s GPT to\\nthe browser\\n. On the Next.js side, use libraries or custom logic to consume events. (Libraries like\\nEventSource  in the browser or packages like assistant-stream  can help.)\\nState and Conversation History: LangChain provides built-in memory classes (buffer, summary,\\nvector).

For  longer  context,  combine  RAG:  store  past\\ninteractions in vector DB and retrieve as context. The books above cover merging memory chains. In\\ncode, you might implement conversation state management in your FastAPI server (store history per\\nuser session or token). The  assistant-ui-langgraph-fastapi  project illustrates maintaining\\nstate across streams\\n.\\nDeployment and Production: For production readiness, plan for auth, error handling, and scaling.\\nAgentKit  is  a  prime  example:  it  includes  NextAuth  integration,  testing,  and  Docker-compose\\ndeployment\\n. If using Vercel/Render, remember their serverless limits (e.g. Python package size\\n). In practice, one may deploy the Next.js frontend on Vercel (or Render/Netlify) and run FastAPI\\nseparately (e.g. on Render or AWS with Docker). For containerization, use uvicorn /Gunicorn for\\nFastAPI, and Dockerize both frontend and backend (AgentKit’s demos can guide this)\\n.

The truth of the matter is that being a gentleman is \\nnot exactly like rocket science.  Being a gentleman requires a little logic, \\nsome forethought, and a great deal of consideration for others. It is not \\nabout complicated rules and convoluted instructions. Instead, it is about \\ntrying to make life easier and more pleasant for one's self and other \\npeople. It is about honestly and sincerely being a 'nice guy'. For a \\ngentleman, the noblest virtues are camaraderie,dependability, \\nunswerving loyalty and compassion.\\n2.\\nMerely acting like a gentleman is not enough: It is being a \\ngentleman that is important, and that means thinking of others, being \\nthere when you are needed and knowing when you are not needed. It is \\nwhat you do and who you are-an accumulation of gentlemanly \\nbehaviour over the course of a lifetime- that make a man - a gentleman. It \\ntruly is possible for a man to learn to be a gentleman if he knows the \\ndirection he needs to follows.  \\nCommon Courtesies a Gentleman Needs to Know and Accumulate \\n3.\\nA Gentleman Feels for Others: A gentleman knows how to make \\nothers feel comfortable. He always perceives a situation from the other \\nperson's perspective and avoids hurting others unnecessarily. \\n4.\\nA Gentleman Walks Through a Door: A gentleman always glances \\nbehind him when he walks through a door.  He never lets a door close in \\nanother person's face.  It does not matter whether the other person is a \\nman or a woman. If it is a revolving door, a gentleman pays more \\nattention than usual. He never shares a revolving door section with \\nanother person.  He respects the other person's space.\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Corel PDF Engine Version 11.633', 'creator': 'CorelDRAW Version 11.0', 'creationdate': '2011-12-05T16:59:40+00:00', 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf_files\\\\service etiquette IMA issued (1) (1).pdf', 'file_path': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf_files\\\\service etiquette IMA issued (1) (1).pdf', 'total_pages': 78, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': 'book final', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2011-12-07T11:08:02+05:30', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20111207110802+05'30'\", 'creationDate': 'D:20111205165940Z', 'page': 5}, page_content=\"5.\\nA Gentleman Gets Dressed: In warm weather a gentleman always \\nwears an undershirt. When a gentleman wears a double-breasted suit, \\nhe never leaves the jacket unbuttoned. A gentleman's trouser cuffs fall in \\na gentle break over his shined shoes. When he stands, his socks do not \\nshow.\\n6.\\nA Gentleman and his Cologne:  A gentleman considers his cologne \\nas an intimate apparel and should be worn accordingly. It should not \\ncause comment, positive or negative, among other people in the room. \\nInstead, it should be saved as a pleasant surprise for people with whom \\nhe makes close physical contact. A gentleman understands that a \\ncologne is, after all, an accessory, not a substitute for a deodorant. When \\nworn in excess, the cologne is annoying and raises doubts if odours are \\nbeing covered up. Desirably a cologne or a perfume is applied on 'pulse \\npoints' i.e. on the wrists, behind the ears on the neck and the armpits for \\nbest results.\\n7.\\nA Gentleman's Shoewear: A gentleman knows that even today, \\nblack shoes are considered more formal and serious than brown shoes.  \\nIn fact, in the legal profession, black shoes remain the only truly \\nacceptable footwear. Semi formal and formal occasions are best \\nattended wearing black shoes with laces. The loafers and moccasins are \\nbest left for informal attendances. Only in your riding clothes you must \\nbe conservative.  If you can get boots made on English lines, wear them; \\notherwise wear leggings. And remember, that all leather must be real \\nleather in the first place and polished until its surface is like glass.  \\n8.\\nA Gentleman and his Cap: A gentleman will probably own a stack \\nof golf/baseball/cricket caps/hats, which he wears after work, on \\nweekends, or on casual days at the office. These accessories are \\nprimarily for preventing exposure to the sun and are best used in this \\nmanner only. He does not wear his cap inside most public buildings- \\nespecially houses of worship except in a 'Gurudwara'. Traditionally, a \\ngentleman would remove his hat if he were greeting a woman or being \\nintroduced to a new acquaintance of either sex. A gentleman washes his \\nhair regularly, and he makes every effort to prevent dandruff. “When a \\ngentleman feels the urge to colour his moustache, he should desirably \\nshave it off.”\\n02\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Corel PDF Engine Version 11.633', 'creator': 'CorelDRAW Version 11.0', 'creationdate': '2011-12-05T16:59:40+00:00', 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf_files\\\\service etiquette IMA issued (1) (1).pdf', 'file_path': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf_files\\\\service etiquette IMA issued (1) (1).pdf', 'total_pages': 78, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': 'book final', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2011-12-07T11:08:02+05:30', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20111207110802+05'30'\", 'creationDate': 'D:20111205165940Z', 'page': 6}, page_content=\"9.\\nA Gentleman Knows how to Leave a Tip: Leaving a tip is a delicate \\nmatter that concerns only the gentleman and the server. He does not \\nbrag about leaving a generous gratuity. If the service has been inferior, a \\ngentleman does not inform his companions that he plans to leave a less \\nthan-sizable tip. A gentleman should leave a tip in a restaurant or a bar \\nbut not at a self service fast food establishment. The word Tip is even \\nconsidered as an acronym by some, which is supposed to stand for “To \\nImprove Promptness “which is self explanatory for the process”. \\n10. A Gentleman Says the Right Thing: A gentleman knows that \\n“please” and “thank you” continue to be the magic words, and uses \\nthem as profusely as possible. \\n11. How to Start a Conversation:  At a party, a reception, or a business \\nmeeting, a gentleman strikes up a conversation with any pleasant \\nperson he encounters. To prevent awkwardness, however, he begins with \\na positive and noncontroversial subject matter. In every case, a \\ngentleman begins by asking a question that does not bring the \\nconversation around to himself. If the person standing next to him \\nresponds cordially, he continues with a few more questions until the \\nconversation is under way. A gentleman always avoids Slangs, as it does \\nnot beautify, but sullies conversation.\\n12. When to Use First Name: Although the world at large is on a first-\\nname basis today, a gentleman knows it is always safe, on first meeting, \\nto address a new acquaintance as “Mr” or “Ms” He depends upon this \\nguideline, especially if the new acquaintance is an elder person or if he \\nis dealing with his superior in a formal environment. \\n13. Manner in which to end a Conversation: A gentleman recognizes \\nthat every conversation has its own natural rhythm. He is not being rude \\nor inconsiderate when he attempts to bring any conversation; no matter \\nhow pleasant or how important  to a timely close. When talking on the \\ntelephone, a gentleman accepts the responsibility for ending any \\nconversation he has begun. On the telephone, he may say something as \\nsimple as, “It's been very good talking to you”. \\n \\n14.

I \\nhope we get to talk again soon”.\\n15. Way to Respond to An Insult: When a gentleman has been \\nsubjected to a conscious insult, either in public or in private, his \\nresponse is simple: Because he is a gentleman, he says nothing at all.“A \\ngentleman always thinks before he speaks”.\\n: \\n: \\n: \\n16. Saying, “I'm Sorry” Although he attempts at all times to be \\nconsiderate of others, a gentleman sometimes does make mistakes. In \\nsuch instances, he owns up to his failings and attempts to rectify the \\nwrong doing before matters grow any worse. In making an apology, a \\ngentleman is direct and to the point. If he has unintentionally made a \\nremark that has hurt another person's feelings, he may say,” I am \\nsorry.” In doing so, a gentleman does not downplay his error.  Neither \\ndoes he dramatise it. If an apology is sincerely offered, a gentleman \\naccepts it with good grace.  He does not pretend that the offence never \\nexisted, but he considers it past history and moves on. “A gentleman \\nknows how to keep an apology simple.  He does not hold a grudge”.  \\nAwkward situations of office are never carried back home by a \\ngentleman or even on social occasions where official colleagues are \\npresent. However, there is no time or place to say “I'm sorry.”\\n17. Writing a Condolence Note It is appropriate for a gentleman to \\nexpress condolence upon the death of someone he has known, admired, \\nor respected. He may express his sympathy to a friend who has lost a \\nloved one, even if he never met the deceased. The simplest statements are \\nmost eloquent. A gentleman, to comfort a friend, might write, “I know \\nthe loss is irreplaceable for you. My thoughts are with you in this difficult \\ntime”. Such a note/letter should end with the salutation 'Yours in Grief'.  \\nA gentleman never says, “Please let me know if there is anything I can \\ndo”.  Instead he offers to supply a meal for the family, to run an errand, \\nor to watch the house while the family is away, as the need arises, which \\nshows his thoughtfulness and concern.\\n18.

A gentleman knows, however, that it is useless to make a complaint \\nunless it is made to the right person. When a gentleman makes a \\ncomplaint, he describes specifically the reasons for his displeasure. He \\ndoes not make threats. “A gentleman has definite beliefs, but he thinks \\nbefore voicing his opinions. He recognises that other people's beliefs are \\nvalid.  He argues only over an issue that could save a life”.\\n20. A Gentleman Attends a Funeral: A Gentleman recognises that a \\nfuneral is a time for paying respects. He keeps his remarks simple, out of \\nrespect for the grieving person's overwrought emotions. A gentleman \\nmay attend the funeral of anyone he has known personally or \\nprofessionally, at least if they have been on speaking terms. He does \\nremember that differences of opinion or personal differences do not \\nmatter after demise.\\n21. A Gentleman Attends a Wedding: Obviously, a gentleman only \\nattends weddings to which he has been invited.  If his invitation does not \\nsay “and guest,” he attends alone, even if a reception follows. He \\narrives on time and sits in the appropriate place, wishes the bride and \\ngroom, and departs only after exchanging pleasantries with the person \\nwho has invited him.    \\n22. A Gentleman Goes Through a Checkout Line: A gentleman \\nalways keeps an accurate count of the items in his grocery cart. He does \\nnot try to slip through the express checkout line if he has exceeded the \\nposted limit. When it is time to pay the total, a gentleman has his cheque \\nbook, cash , or credit card ready.  A gentleman does not cause a delay in \\nthe checkout line.  \\n23. A Gentleman Attends the Theatre: Because he respects other \\npeople, a gentleman always shows up on time for any performance, \\nwhether it is a concert, a motion picture, or a stage play.  In every case, \\nhe follows the instructions of the ushers. And, if he has a tendency to \\ncough, he always carries a cough drop.

If coughing is \\ninevitable the handkerchief should be handy, and any coughing that \\nneeds to be done should be in the handkerchief.

A Gentleman Takes an Airplane Flight: Almost invariably, the \\npassengers on an airplane have been brought together by a mix of \\nchance and necessity.  A gentleman understands that, in such situations, \\nit is important for everyone to abide by the rules. He brings on board \\nonly the amount of luggage that is permitted. He also always respects the \\nprivacy and space of his co-passenger. \\n25. A Gentleman Gives a Party:  Wherever he can avoid it, a gentleman \\ndoes not extend last minute invitations. He has interesting friends, and \\nhe respects the fact that they have busy schedules. If he receives a call \\nwhile he is entertaining, he politely asks if he may return it later.\\n26. What Every Gentleman Host Should Know: When he acts as a host \\nin his own home or in a restaurant; a gentleman does everything in his \\npower to entertain his guests. He knows that his goal is to put them at \\nease, not to impress them.  A gentleman sometimes discovers that he has \\nmade the mistake of inviting ill-mannered people into his home. He does \\nnot attempt to reform such people's behaviour. Instead, he does not invite \\nthem back to his home.\\n27. Setting up a Bar:  A gentleman does not stock his bar in order to \\nimpress people. He stocks his bar with the drinks people actually want to \\ndrink.  In every case, a gentleman makes sure to offer a variety of mixers, \\nnot just for the pleasure of his drinking friends, but out of consideration \\nfor his teetotaller guests as well. Quality, a gentleman knows, is always \\nmore important than quirkiness. A gentleman knows that his bar is never \\ncomplete without ample ice, sliced limes, a jigger, a stirrer, and a tall \\nstack of hand  ironed, starched cotton cocktail napkins.\\n28.

Responding to an Invitation\\nA gentleman wastes no time in \\nresponding to an invitation.  If he sees the letters RSVP (an abbreviation \\nfor Repondez Sil Vous Plait, the French equivalent of “Reply if you \\nplease”), he is obligated to respond, either by telephone or in writing. \\nSample of RSVP is writing, “Thank you very much for your kind \\ninvitation. I would be delighted to attend… .  An RSVP requires that he \\nreplies whether or not he plans to attend the event in question.  In case \\nfor any reason, he is unable to attend a party, he sends his regrets in \\nwritten and well in time.  If it is annotated “Regrets only”, he needs to \\ninform his host or hostess only if he does not plan to show up. A \\ngentleman understands that it is vastly inconsiderate for him not to make \\nhis intentions known.\\n: \\n30. If a gentleman needs to decline an invitation, he gives a \\nstraightforward reason for doing so. A gentleman does not lay down \\nconditions for his accepting an invitation. He accepts the invitation \\ngladly and proves to himself that because he is a gentleman, he can have \\na good time in any company, at any time. When a gentleman discovers \\nthat he can attend a party for which he has already refused an invitation, \\nhe calls his host or hostess and asks if he may attend.                         \\n31. Being a Guest at a Party: A gentleman knows that accepting an \\ninvitation is like signing a business contract. His host promises to \\nentertain the guests, and he agrees to do his part to make the event a \\nsuccess. He arrives on time-not early and never more than five minutes \\nlate. He participates in the activities that have been planned, and he \\nmakes pleasant conversation with the other guests. He does not \\noverindulge at the bar. When the party is winding down, he exits with \\nefficient grace.  He thanks his host or hostess and says good-bye to any \\nnew friends he may have made. At a party a gentleman never spends all \\nhis time talking to one person. He always endeavours to meet as many \\nladies and gentlemen as possible, and he assumes that all in the \\ngathering will enjoy meeting him too.\\n32. Taking a Gift: When a gentleman is invited for a dinner party, he \\ntakes a bouquet of flowers or a bottle of wine (unchilled, so that the host \\nor hostess knows that it is a gift, and is not intended to accompany \\ndinner).

Even if he carries a gift, a gentleman also sends a thank you note \\nat his first opportunity, preferably the day after the party. \\n33. Sending a 'Thank You' Note\\nA gentleman always sends a 'thank \\nyou' note after attending an invitation. The host or hostess need not reply \\nto a 'thank you' note.\\n34. A Gentleman and his Friends\\nA gentleman never gets so big that \\nhe can feel free to say or do things that make other people feel small. A \\ngentleman does not lend more money than he can afford to spare. He \\ndoes not borrow money from friends or acquaintances. The Equated \\nMonthly Instalments (EMIs) borrowed from institutionalized bankers \\nare always expected to be paid on time from a gentleman, lest \\nembarrassment is caused to him or his organisation.    \\n35. Dealing with Non-drinkers A gentleman may have friends who do \\nnot consume or take alcohol, whatever the reason for that choice-\\nreligious belief, health, or aversion- a gentleman respects it. He does not \\nforce anyone to take alcohol; neither does he ask probing questions. He \\nmakes certain that his non-drinking friends have plenty of appealing \\nnon-alcoholic options. If a gentleman chooses not to consume alcohol, \\nhe does not impose that decision on other people.  If he is offered an \\nalcoholic drink, he may say, “Thanks, but I don't drink or take alcohol”.  \\nHe offers no further explanation.\\n36. Shaking of Hands\\nA gentleman may feel free to shake hands with \\nanyone to whom he is introduced, or with any acquaintance he \\nencounters in a social situation, whether at a party, in a theatre lobby, or \\nin a place of worship. However, a gentleman does respect certain \\nguidelines. When he is introduced to an older person or to a dignitary, a \\ngentleman does not extend his hand first. Instead, he waits until a \\nhandshake is offered. Then he firmly grasps the extended hand, just \\nbelow the knuckles, and gives it a couple of modest pumps. He uses a \\nlight, painless grip and let's go immediately after the handshake is \\nfinished.\\n37. A gentleman never extends his hand to a woman first.  It is always \\nher prerogative to decide if she wishes to shake hands.

If a lady \\ndoes not extend her hand, a gentleman simply nods his head. One has to \\nbe very careful while shaking hands with a lady, especially in terms of \\npressure that is applied in the process. One must avoid a vice like grip at \\nall costs. A gentleman never refuses to shake a hand that is extended to \\nhim.  Such a refusal is the most blatant insult possible. \\n38. Sending Flowers\\nA gentleman feels free to send flowers to mark \\nalmost any occasion. Flowers may celebrate an anniversary, a birthday, \\na holiday, a promotion, the birth of a baby, or any other joyful moment in \\nlife.  They are the perfect means of thanking a host or hostess, and they \\nmay be sent either before or after the party. On the other hand, flowers \\nmay also be sent to comfort a grieving family or to brighten a sick \\nperson\\'s room. They may be sent to say “I\\'m sorry” when a gentleman \\nhas been guilty of an unintentional affront. At the same time, a gentleman \\nknows that there are a few occasions when flowers- or at least certain \\ntypes of flowers are not the right gesture. If a mourning family has asked \\nthat no flowers be sent to a funeral, a gentleman sends none.  He does not \\nsend flowers to his secretary- or to any other co-worker  at her/his home. \\nHowever sending the appropriate rose colour bouquet conveys \\nmessages in a very special and beautiful way. RED roses show love, \\npassion and respect. WHITE roses signify spiritual love and purity; but \\nof the soul; bridal white means happy love. White roses can also signify \\nsecrecy, reverence humility, innocence, or charm. YELLOW shows \"I \\ncare\"; friendship, joy, gladness or freedom.\\n39. Being a House-Guest\\nAs a guest in a private home a gentleman \\ntreats his host\\'s furniture and other belongings with the greatest care, \\neven more carefully than if they were his own. In every case, a gentleman \\nattempts to fit into the household routine.  He rises and retires according \\nto the household schedule. He eats what is served and does not \\ncomplain. He makes his bed in the morning, and he disposes off damp \\ntowels as he is instructed. Most important, he sticks to his arrival and \\ndeparture plans. When his visit is over, he checks his room to make sure \\nhe has packed all his belonging and ensures that nothing from the \\nhousehold where he has stayed is packed with his belongings even \\ninadvertently.  He leaves nothing but pleasant memories behind.\\n:  \\n:  \\n09'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Corel PDF Engine Version 11.633', 'creator': 'CorelDRAW Version 11.0', 'creationdate': '2011-12-05T16:59:40+00:00', 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf_files\\\\service etiquette IMA issued (1) (1).pdf', 'file_path': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf_files\\\\service etiquette IMA issued (1) (1).pdf', 'total_pages': 78, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': 'book final', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2011-12-07T11:08:02+05:30', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20111207110802+05'30'\", 'creationDate': 'D:20111205165940Z', 'page': 13}, page_content=\"40. Dealing with Divorced Friends\\nA gentleman regrets seeing any \\nloving relationship break up, especially if he considers both persons to \\nbe his friends. However, his regret is for their pain. He does not take \\nsides in their marital discord; he does not carry tales back and forth \\nbetween the two.  \\n41. If his friends are recently divorced, a gentleman does not attempt to \\nput them in embarrassing situations - a small dinner party, for example - \\nwhere they will be forced to encounter each other. He tries to maintain \\ncommunication with both parties, but he understands that he is now \\nfriends with two people, not with one couple. Maintaining these \\nfriendships may require twice as much effort and time. \\n42. The Etiquette of the Answering Machine A gentleman never \\nassumes that everyone recognizes his voice on an answering machine.  \\nHe speaks clearly, identifies himself, and leaves his phone number.  \\nBetter yet, he speaks slowly and gives the number twice. He leaves his \\nmessage and then gets on with his life. When a gentleman's phone \\nmessage is not returned in time and a deadline is involved, he calls back \\nand if necessary, leaves a second message. At this point, it is the other \\nperson's responsibility to return the call. If a gentleman receives a \\nmessage that involves a deadline, he returns the message promptly.\\n43. A Gentleman and his Boss Even in today's egalitarian society, a \\ngentleman remembers that in all situations, there is a chain of command.  \\nHe may be on a first-name basis with his senior, and they may enjoy an \\noccasional golf game together, but he still remembers who is in charge in \\nthe office. He accepts his work assignments with good cheer and grace.  \\nIf a gentleman feels the need to deny a request from his boss, he gives his \\nreason for doing so, with frankness and without delay.  \\n44. If a gentleman is entertained in his boss's home, he treats his boss \\nand his boss's spouse just as he would treat any other host and hostess.  \\nHe may take a small gift/flowers if it seems appropriate.  \\n45. A Gentleman and his Secretary\\nA gentleman treats his secretary, \\nand any other members of his staff, with all the respect due to a valued \\nco-worker and a fellow human being.

He is \\ncareful to keep the line clearly drawn between his personal and \\nprofessional lives. If his level of trust is great enough, he may ask his \\nsecretary to make his bank deposit for him. He may give her/him a gift on \\na special occasion  such as on an anniversary or birthday  but he is \\nalways wise to stick with flowers, a book, or some other impersonal item. \\nNo matter how many years the two of them may have worked together, \\nand no matter how pressing the deadlines of their work, a gentleman \\ndoes not neglect to tell his secretary, “Thank you.” Even if he is only \\nasking her/him to make photocopies, he does not forget to say, “Please”.\\n46. The Etiquette for e-mail\\nA gentleman treats e-mail like any other \\nwritten correspondence. He expresses himself clearly and concisely.  He \\nindicates the topic of his correspondence in the “Subject” line of his \\nemail, so that the recipient can identify it in his or her directory. If a \\ngentleman is sending a copy of his e-mail to a second co-respondent, he \\nindicates that he is sending a copy in the same way that he would use \\n“cc” at the bottom of a letter. He knows that an e-mail is never \\ncompletely private, since it is read on a computer screen and often in an \\noffice environment. To save embarrassment to himself and to his co-\\nrespondent, he is discreet about the messages he sends especially about \\nthe kind of language used. Using of capital letters in e-mails amounts to \\nshouting as per net etiquette, hence using capital letters in the text, other \\nthan where necessitated by grammar is to be avoided.   \\n47.

Military etiquette is the term used to classify those customary acts \\nand ceremonial procedures, which are required between members of the \\nArmed forces. It implies polite and considerate behaviour towards \\nothers whether junior or senior and whether or not a member of the \\nArmed forces. The courtesy shown to a senior is recognition of his \\nresponsibility and authority of his position.  The methods of expressing \\nmilitary courtesy and etiquette are distinctive and precise. Slovenly, \\ngrudging or perfunctory display of these methods is discourteous and \\ntherefore undesirable.\\n22. These military and social etiquettes have a profound meaning. A \\nsalute to the flag is a declaration of loyalty to India and to the principles \\nof liberty and justice on which the nation is founded. When a military \\nman presents arms or salutes a senior, it is recognition of the \\norganisational authority vested in him by the nation.\\n23. Saluting and its Reasons: Saluting in the Armed Forces is a sign of \\nrecognition between men of an honourable profession. It is a centuries \\nold service tradition maintained by regulations. A salute being normally \\nrendered by the right hand, in case of any physical disability if a person \\nis unable to do so, he will salute with the left hand.\\n24. In Office: It is customary for an officer entering the office of an \\nequal in rank to salute. Thereafter, the visiting officer should only move \\nto occupy a chair on being offered one. To do so otherwise would be \\nimproper.\\n25. On the entry of an officer senior to him in rank, the officer in the \\nchair should rise and then as per the time of the day greet him such as \\n“Good Morning” or “Good Afternoon” Sir. The senior officer will then \\nacknowledge the respect shown to him by saluting and exchanging the \\ngreeting with a few appropriate words.Thereafter service etiquette \\nrequires that the junior officer offers a chair to the senior officer. He is \\nnot to resume until the senior is seated or has permitted him to be seated \\nby a remark such as “please sit down” or something similar. On being \\noffered a seat a visiting officer is permitted to remove his cap or beret.\\n26. On leaving the office, the visitor will salute in case he is junior to or \\n30'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Corel PDF Engine Version 11.633', 'creator': 'CorelDRAW Version 11.0', 'creationdate': '2011-12-05T16:59:40+00:00', 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf_files\\\\service etiquette IMA issued (1) (1).pdf', 'file_path': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf_files\\\\service etiquette IMA issued (1) (1).pdf', 'total_pages': 78, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': 'book final', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2011-12-07T11:08:02+05:30', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20111207110802+05'30'\", 'creationDate': 'D:20111205165940Z', 'page': 34}, page_content='equal status with the officer in the chair. In the event of the visitor being \\nsenior, the junior officer in the chair will rise and the senior officer \\nreturns the compliment by a salute.\\n27. A wrong practice based on ignorance is the practice of senior \\nofficers initiating a salute while entering the office of a junior and the \\njunior officer failing to rise from the chair on the entry of a senior officer.  \\nThe assumption being that it is the office/chair, which is respected, and \\nnot so much the officer. It must be clearly understood that it is the \\nofficer, who is saluted, and not the office.  \\n28. Returning Salutes of JCOs and OR: An officer must return the \\nsalute of a JCO or an OR smartly, looking at him directly in the eye. Off \\nparade, it is now customary for an officer to acknowledge a salute from a \\nsubordinate by accompanying his salute with a remark like “Ram Ram, \\nSahib or “Sat Sri Akal, Sahib”.The word Sahib is added in the case of \\nJCOs only.  However, it is not the custom to exchange such greetings \\nwith a sentry at the quarter guard.\\n29. Two or more Officers Together: When two or more officers are \\ntogether, only the senior will acknowledge salutes. If the senior officer in \\na group should fail to return a salute, and if there is inadequate time to \\ndraw his attention to the compliment being paid, a junior officer will \\nreturn the salute. To avoid doing so would amount to“Cutting”a \\nsubordinate, which is unpardonable. When two or more junior officers \\nmeet an officer of the rank of Major and above, all the junior officers will \\nsalute.  In case of two officers of different ranks conversing together and \\na third who is senior to one of them but junior to the other either passes \\nby or joins them, the junior-most officer will not salute. On the other \\nhand the new arrival to the group will pay the normal compliments to the \\nsenior-most as required by regulations.\\n30. Officers Walking Together: When two or more officers are walking \\ntogether, it should be possible to distinguish their respective seniorities \\nfrom their relative positions.  For instance, when two officers of unequal \\nseniority walk together, the senior is on the right and the junior of the two \\non his left. In the same way, if three officers of different ranks are walking \\ntogether the senior most walks in the centre, the next senior on his right \\nand the junior most on his left.

The National Flag: It is customary to salute the national flag when \\nit is being hoisted or hailed down at Reveille and Retreat respectively.  \\nOfficers will face the flag, stand to attention and salute.\\n32. National Anthem, National Salute & General Salute: When the \\nNational Anthem is played in a ceremonial parade all officers will stand \\nto attention and salute. The officers on parade will do so on the order of \\nthe parade commander.\\n33. On other official occasions where the National Anthem is being \\nplayed by the band, all officers will stand to attention and if wearing a \\nhead gear will salute.

In such a situation, it is correct \\nto remove the hat with the right hand and place it across the left breast \\npocket.\\n34. If on passing a shop, such as a radio dealer, in case the National \\nAnthem is heard being played officers will not pay compliments.  \\n35. Public Conveyance: Saluting is not exchanged in public places like \\nRailway Stations, Cinema halls etc. However, an exchange of greetings \\nis both courteous and correct.     \\n36. Correct Use of Titles: Owing to the fact that there is very little \\nsimilarity in the rank titles used by the three services it is important to \\navoid committing mistakes especially in the use of abbreviations.  \\nFollowing are the correct abbreviations:-\\n(a) Lieutenant, Sub Lieutenant and Flying Officers are \\naddressed as “Mister”.\\n(b) In private correspondence Lieutenant Colonel's are \\naddressed as Colonel.

It is the home of all officers of the unit, \\nparticularly the living - in officers, that is, those who dine in the Mess. As \\nan institution it has a great influence on shaping an officer's life, his \\nsocial initiation into service life and the inculcation of gentlemanly \\ndemeanour more so in the case of young officers. The social life in a \\nstation revolves around the officers' mess. \\n2.\\nOfficers must treat their mess as a home and it must always be a \\nsymbol of pride of the unit and the repository of its trophies; officers \\nought to know the history of each piece of silver, trophy, painting, \\nfurniture and other property in the mess and they should zealously look \\nafter it. The young officers and their families are taken around the \\nOfficers' Mess and explained the significance of paintings, silver pieces \\nand other historical possessions of the Mess, to inculcate a feeling of \\npride amongst them. Mess customs and traditions instil in officers a \\nstrong sense of loyalty, camaraderie and cooperation.\\nCustoms in the Mess\\n3.\\nEach Regiment has a special set of rules and customs pertaining to \\nthe dress to be worn and ceremonies in the Officers' Mess.  As in the case \\nof a home, Messes conform to a certain amount of domestic ritual, which \\nthey expect their members and guests to follow. Officers must take a \\npersonal pride in adhering to their Mess customs, no matter how \\nstrange and unusual they may appear to be.  Customs in these respects, \\nwhich are largely followed, are of a widely accepted pattern in each \\nService. An officer on posting or attachment to a regiment should \\nascertain all he can about the customs peculiar to that mess and the \\ndress regulations observed in the mess. It could be embarrassing or even \\nhumiliating to unwittingly fail to observe established customs of the \\nOfficers' Mess. In a well-run Mess, the correct atmosphere of informality \\nand freedom from service routine is maintained. Mess silver, that is the \\ntrophies, are, by custom, not to be touched or disturbed.

On special occasions, \\nother forms of dress may be stipulated. Normal dresses that are required \\nto be worn in the messes are specified on the notice boards of the Messes \\nand must be adhered to.

General Courtesy Towards Members of the Mess: Officers of the \\nrank of Major, Lieutenant Commander and Squadron Leader are always \\naddressed as “Sir” by their juniors in the service. It is not necessary for a \\nCaptain or an officer of equivalent rank in the other Services to be \\naddressed as “Sir” by an officer of a junior rank.\\n11. Whilst in the Mess, an officer must avoid playing the radio, TV or \\nmusic system loudly, or monopolising a fan, seat near the fire or the \\nmorning paper. It is correct for an officer wishing to play the TV/ music \\nsystem to seek permission to do so from the other members present. If a \\nsenior officer is without a chair, he should be immediately offered one by \\nthe junior officer.\\n12. Ladies in the Mess:  It is customary for ladies to be invited to \\ncertain special functions in the Mess.  Apart from these occasions, ladies \\nare not invited to the Officers' Mess. All Messes have a special room, \\ncalled the Ladies Room, where lady guests may be entertained.  Any lady \\nentering the Mess is treated with utmost courtesy. The most appropriate \\neating arrangements when ladies are invited to the Mess is the buffet \\nstyle.\\n39\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Corel PDF Engine Version 11.633', 'creator': 'CorelDRAW Version 11.0', 'creationdate': '2011-12-05T16:59:40+00:00', 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf_files\\\\service etiquette IMA issued (1) (1).pdf', 'file_path': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf_files\\\\service etiquette IMA issued (1) (1).pdf', 'total_pages': 78, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': 'book final', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2011-12-07T11:08:02+05:30', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20111207110802+05'30'\", 'creationDate': 'D:20111205165940Z', 'page': 43}, page_content=\"13. When being entertained in the Officers' Mess, it is appropriate for \\nladies to move around and converse with the hosts and guests present. If \\nnecessary the officer should instruct his wife on the etiquette to be \\nobserved in such matters. It is also up to the Officers to meet the ladies \\nand engage them in conversation.\\n14. Conversation in the Mess: Loose gossip concerning women is \\nprohibited in the Mess. This custom has been handed down through the \\nages and is strictly observed in both letter and spirit.  It has its roots in \\nthe traditional chivalry of officers.Controversial subjects such as \\nreligion or politics should also not be discussed in the Mess.The use of \\nswear words, apart from being most ungentlemanly, is prohibited in the \\nMess.\\n15. Letters: Letters will not be opened at the table.

Smoking: Always take permission from the senior most officer \\npresent in the room before smoking.The senior officer may give \\npermission to smoke either verbally or by lighting a cigarette himself. \\nThis permission is given verbally, by mentioning it to officer nearest to \\nhim, the others taking their cue from this officer. It is traditional that at \\nthe dinner table, officers do not smoke their own cigarettes. This custom, \\nit is said, derives from the clannish feeling, inspired by smoking from the \\nsame 'hookah'. Do not smoke when ladies or children are around.  \\n17. Alcoholic Drinks: Correct etiquette is that before dinner officers \\nshould refrain from having too many drinks. Between the first and the \\nsecond bugle for dinner, it is 'not done' to take beer or whisky. However, \\nif there is sufficient time, a small whisky soda may be taken.The aim of \\nthis convention is to avoid gulping down a long drink before going to \\ndinner. It is against regulations for an officer to offer a fellow member \\na drink in the Mess. Every member of the Mess who accepts a drink \\nmust pay for it in his Mess bill. This does not apply to offering a drink to \\na Mess guest.\\n40\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Corel PDF Engine Version 11.633', 'creator': 'CorelDRAW Version 11.0', 'creationdate': '2011-12-05T16:59:40+00:00', 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf_files\\\\service etiquette IMA issued (1) (1).pdf', 'file_path': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf_files\\\\service etiquette IMA issued (1) (1).pdf', 'total_pages': 78, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': 'book final', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2011-12-07T11:08:02+05:30', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20111207110802+05'30'\", 'creationDate': 'D:20111205165940Z', 'page': 44}, page_content=\"Conduct  in  the  Mess.  \\n18.

Every accessory that builds the table picture - the silver, china, \\nglass and linen serve as an index to the tastes and social standing of the \\nMess. The harmony and unity of setting of these accessories should \\nindicate that it is arranged according to a definite standard.

As a general guide, stock whisky, rum, vodka, wine and beer as bare \\nnecessities while hosting a formal party. Liqueur is served on formal \\noccasions only. Do not force a guest to drink as if there were no \\ntomorrow. The onus of maintaining the sanctity and decorum of your \\nhome / Mess lies on you. \\n55. However, in order that we should not be considered to suffer from \\nlack of social graces, it is useful to know the normal layout of wine \\nglasses and the association of wines at lunches and dinners.\\n56. Wines Generally, white wine goes with white meat and red wine \\nwith red meat. A light red wine can be served with white meat dishes if \\nthese are served with a dark sauce. A fuller red wine is served with more \\nstrongly flavoured red meat dishes such as roasts. The decanter is passed \\naround the table from right to left (clockwise). Red wines are best served \\nat 15.5 to 18 deg C, white wines between 12.5 to 15.5 deg C and \\nsparkling wines between 4.5 to 10 deg C. It is customary for red wines to \\nbe uncorked and allowed to stand for an hour before serving. A fine old \\nred wine should be decanted to separate the sediment and allow the wine \\nto breathe. In no case will water be added to wines.  If offered a choice \\nduring the main course the diner should state clearly what he or she \\nwould like. During dinner the wine waiter is likely to refill the glass if \\nempty.  If the diner does not wish it to be refilled and is talking to \\nsomeone, he or she places a finger just over the rim of the glass and the \\nbearer will understand that no more is required.

Entertaining is an art and any party is a purposeful lesson in \\ncreativity. Selecting the food, the look of the table, the wine stock, etc, are \\nimportant facets to playing a successful host and carrying off a \\nsignificant occasion. A few formal dining tips are given out as follows :-\\n(a)\\nA typical formal course comprises of soup, starters, main \\ncourse, sweet dish, dessert and coffee. A traditional, meticulous yet \\nsumptuous formal course may have appetizers, soup, fish course, \\nfirst meat dish, main meat dish, vegetable accompaniments, \\nentremets, dessert and coffee. \\n(b)\\nEach course is served with its own cutlery.\\n(c)\\nFood is served from the left and used plates cleared from the \\nright.\\n(d)\\nBeverages are served from the right.\\n(e)\\nA tray is not used while serving food.\\n(f)\\nFood comes up to you; do not bend. Elbows should be off the \\ntable.\\n(g)\\nTable should be completely cleared before serving the dessert.\\n(h)\\nDo not cut your food up into bite size pieces to start with and \\nthen start picking one by one. It looks childish.\\n(j )   Do not groom yourself at the table, use your cell phone or \\nsmoke during the courses. \\n61. Entrée: An entrée is a light dish and is usually accompanied by a \\nsauce, which may or may not be an integral part of the dish. It should \\nalways, if possible, be eaten with a fork alone. Cutlets or sweetbreads \\ngenerally require the use of a knife. Hot entrees ordinarily precede a \\nroast and the cold entrees follow it.\\n62. Soup: The first course to be served at dinner is usually soup for \\nwhich a soup spoon is laid. If fried breadcrumbs or powdered cheese are \\noffered the spoon provided should be used to help one self. There should \\nbe no noise when taking soup. The spoon should be used as noiselessly as \\npossible, and taken from the side, not from the front.

Bread: Dinner rolls or bread are normal accompaniment at \\ndinners, and can be eaten from the time soup is served till the course \\npreceding the dessert. In most cases dinner rolls/bread are eaten off the \\nside plate. However certain Messes have the tradition of eating bread \\ndirectly off the table. In such cases some Messes do away with the table \\ncloth and bread is eaten directly off the surface of the table. It may be \\nnoticed that in such a case, crumbles are brushed off the table by the \\nwaiters after the table is cleared, prior to the presidential toast.\\n64. Fish: A fish knife and fish fork is laid for this service; the blade of \\nthe knife is silver, not steel. The knife is held in the right hand and fork in \\nthe left hand. Hold the fish with the knife and carefully draw the flesh off \\nthe bone using the fork, pushing the latter to the side of the plate, and \\neating small portions of the fish using the fork. Fish is sometimes served \\nwith sauce to which one may help one self from the sauce bowl in small \\nquantities.\\n65. Meat: Usually large knives and fork are provided for this course.  \\nThe correct way to eat meat and rice is with a spoon and fork or only a \\nfork. Do not start to eat until the various vegetables and sauces have \\nbeen served. \\n66. Chapati: When chapatis form part of the meal, it will be kept in the \\nside plate on the left hand and portions broken off or rolled up with the \\nleft hand as required. Alternatively, chapatis can be eaten using the right \\nhand to break small portion of the chapati, place the vegetable on the \\nchapati using the fork holding the fork in the left hand.

Vegetables and Salads: Vegetables are always eaten with a fork. \\nSalad should be eaten from the plate (often crescent-shaped) on which it \\nis served, that is, if it is served separately, but cucumber is eaten from the \\ndinner plate.

When eating cheese, small pieces should be pushed with the knife \\non to small pieces of biscuits (broken with the fingers only) or bread and \\nconveyed to the mouth with the thumb and index finger.\\n71. Knives and forks are held primarily with the thumb and first finger.  \\nThe end of the handle should rest in the palm of the hand.  When pausing \\nin the middle of a course, the knife and  fork  should  be  laid  on  the  \\nplate, crossing  at  the  tip  and never resting on the side of             \\nthe plate with the handle on table. When the course is finished, the knife \\nand fork are laid together side by side the knife right side up, and the fork \\nwith the tines (or points) turned upwards) in the middle of the plate. To \\nkeep these implements open indicates that another helping is desired.\\n72. Toasted Bread: A slice of toasted bread should be first cut to the size \\nof a small mouthful, then buttered and jammed, and then eaten. This \\nprocess should be repeated for each morsel.  For fine crisp wafers, first \\nbreak them into fragments by pressing against either the table or the \\nquarter plate and then eat with the left hand while eating soup. On no \\naccount should bread, as opposed to crisps, be placed in any beverage, \\ngravy or soup.\\n73. Beverages: Each beverage has its own peculiarity, but in common \\nwith each other they should be drunk slowly and in appropriate sips, and \\nnever gulped down. Water in particular should not be poured down one's \\nthroat! All drinking should be noiseless. Mouth should be only \\nsufficiently opened to take in the liquid with a quiet sip.\\n60\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Corel PDF Engine Version 11.633', 'creator': 'CorelDRAW Version 11.0', 'creationdate': '2011-12-05T16:59:40+00:00', 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf_files\\\\service etiquette IMA issued (1) (1).pdf', 'file_path': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf_files\\\\service etiquette IMA issued (1) (1).pdf', 'total_pages': 78, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': 'book final', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2011-12-07T11:08:02+05:30', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20111207110802+05'30'\", 'creationDate': 'D:20111205165940Z', 'page': 64}, page_content=\"74.\\nManner of Sitting: The correct manner of sitting at the table is \\nupright with the elbows close in by sides of the body.  The placing of \\nelbows on a table are definitely bad manners.  A good erect posture helps \\nyou eat more gracefully and enjoy your food more. It also shows your \\nhost that you are glad to be at his table, not tired or bored.\\n75. Continental Food: When eating continental food, the fork is held in \\nthe left hand and knife in the right hand throughout the meal.  The food is \\npushed onto the fork by a slight nudge with the side of the knife. Once \\nfirmly on the fork, the food is transferred to the mouth.  Between \\nmouthfuls, do not wave your cutlery in the air or point it at a person to \\nemphasize a point. If you must speak when eating, wait till you have \\nswallowed your mouthful, put down your spoon, fork or knife and then \\nspeak.  \\n76. Calling the Staff: When there is a requirement of calling the \\nattention of the staff, it is not correct to call out loudly or make loud \\nnoises.One is required to raise one's hand to bring the attention of the \\nstaff at the table.\\n77. Move of Seniors: When seniors are sitting at the table or leaving \\nthe table or are passing by, it is expected that the other diners sit erect \\nwithout making any motion. \\n78.

In the event of your having \\nescorted a guest into dinner, he or she will be seated on your right. It is \\nrequired of you, therefore, that you first engage the person on your right \\nin small conversation. It is good practice to first talk with the person on \\nyour right and later, during the course of the meal, opens a conversation \\nwith the guest on your left. Conversation across the table should be \\nlimited to the minimum. It is equally bad form to converse across the \\npersons sitting on either side of you.\\n79. Table Napkins: The table napkin is unfolded and placed on the lap. \\nIt is not intended to be used either as a handkerchief or a hand towel.  \\nThe table napkin should be used to dab one's mouth before and after \\ndrinking water and after eating soup.

Ignorance on their part on Defence Service customs, \\ntraditions and obligations leads to avoidable stress, which often impacts \\nupon the entire family. This leads to lack of social cohesion in units. \\n3.\\nTherefore, one of the most important aims of any unit must be to \\nshare with ladies how they should conduct themselves with dignity, \\ngrace and in harmony with the environment, not only amongst the officer \\ncadre but also while interacting with the wives/families of Junior and \\nNon Commissioned Officers and Other Ranks or their equivalents in the \\nNavy and Air Force.
