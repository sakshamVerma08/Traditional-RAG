The name comes from a deadly Maratha\\nweapon dating back to the era of Chhatrapati Shivaji. The ‘Bagh-Nakh’ 1\\nconsisted of four or five curved blades affixed to a crossbar or glove\\ndesigned to slash through skin and muscle. It is believed to have been\\ninspired by the armature of a tiger. The weapon was used by Shivaji to\\nheroically kill the military leader of Bijapur Sultanate, Afzal Khan.\\nToday, the Waghnakhs are the sentinels of India’s Northeast. The\\nbattalion was raised as part of the Baroda State Forces as the 2nd Baroda\\nInfantry in the 1860s and was later amalgamated into the Indian Army as\\nthe 21 Maratha Light Infantry (LI). Then, the battalion was dismantled and\\nmerged into the 20 Maratha LI, which later became the 10 Mechanised\\nInfantry. On 11 February 1985, following Operation Bluestar, 21 Maratha\\nLI was reraised at Belgaum. After its successful tenure in Operation Rhino,\\nit was selected for conversion into a Para (SF) battalion. On 1 February\\n1996, after meeting the stringent probation requirements, it was\\nrechristened as 21 Para (SF), thus becoming the only Para (SF) battalion to\\nbe converted from an existing infantry battalion.\\nThe 21 Para (SF) specializes in jungle warfare, operating in rural and\\nurban scenarios; they are famed for their lethal abilities to carry out cross-\\nborder surgical strikes, such as the ones they carried out in the border areas'),\n",

The\\noperation was executed with such conviction and precision that not one man\\nfrom Mahadik’s side was injured. It was a huge feat.\\nThe Lolab Valley is strategically and operationally critical for the SF as\\nit serves as the staging area for newly inducted terrorists from Pakistan\\ntrying to infiltrate the border in order to enter Kashmir. Here, Mahadik led a\\nnocturnal life, typical of most Para (SF) operatives. Every night he would\\nclimb treacherous hills and mountains laden with snow, carrying his Vz. 58,\\na standard-issue Czechoslovakian-origin gun. His boys from the Alpha\\nteam would match him step for step. In standard formations, and during\\nsuch operations, scouts walk ahead of the rest of the squad, acting as their\\neyes and ears. As a result of the dangers they brave, they are revered figures\\nwith an awe-inspiring reputation in their field.\\nJust like these scouts, Mahadik always preferred—right from the\\nbeginning of his career—to walk ahead of his boys. Watching him was like\\nattending a masterclass: he could show the best scouts how it was done.\\nEver alert, Mahadik would perform all his duties excellently; he knew the\\nslightest mistake on his watch could cost the lives of innocent compatriots.\\nMahadik would effortlessly negotiate the steep incline of the forest floor\\nor climb across perforated crevasses—there was not a twig-break nor a leaf-\\ncrunch to be heard. On alternate nights, when the other squad was not on\\npatrol, he led patrols that returned before the first rays of the morning sun\\nhad touched the valley floor. He would get up at 2.30 a.m. for his shift and\\nstart patrolling. The night would resound with the barking of dogs far away.\\nThere were inputs of heavy infiltration in the area. He kept on following the\\nstandard drills of laying ambush in target areas, but the lack of success in\\nlocating terrorists haunted his slumber. It was the nearby girls’ school that\\ntroubled Mahadik the most, which was where dogs barked the most.\\nSo, one fine day, Capt Mahadik changed his regular course of action and\\ndecided to lay an ambush in the girls’ school. He chose a parapet wall as the\\nperfect cover for the ambush in case of an attack.

Shekhawat, along with his team of paratroopers,\\nincluding young trainees, was training in Ladakh. During one of the combat\\nfree-falls, a soldier who had just joined the forces lost his life after suffering\\na cardiac arrest right after his first jump. Shekhawat had always been\\nparticular about the safety and wellbeing of the men under his command all\\nhis life. He realized something was wrong with the training modules. He\\nread the case report of the young soldier’s death and concluded that it could\\nhave been prevented if the boy had got an opportunity to train themselves in\\na vertical wind tunnel—something all advanced armies (such as in the UK,\\nthe UK and even in Myanmar and Pakistan) do.\\nHe also discovered that the Indian Air Force 48 had been in the process\\nof trying to procure a vertical wind tunnel for the past fifteen years or so, in\\norder to modernize combat free-fall training. However, because of\\nbureaucratic hurdles, this dream had not been achieved till then.\\nOne of the officers, who has worked closely with Brig Shekhawat during\\nthe construction of the vertical wind tunnel, revealed to me that ‘the vertical\\nwind tunnel was not only Col Shekhawat’s passion but also of utmost\\nimportance to the nation. I have seen him working around the clock, day\\nand night, to fulfil this dream—which at one point in time looked almost\\nimpossible. The construction of the tunnel was not easy but it was\\nrevolutionary. Then, he has also trained many tandem masters and created a\\npool of talent for the country to dip into. This helps us immensely on the\\nbattlefield. Imagine taking a doctor, a religious teacher and a sniper (who is\\nnot a free faller) into a battlefield without being detected by the enemy\\nsystem. It can change the whole equation. The vertical wind tunnel speeds\\nup the entire training process along with providing complete safety to the\\nparatroopers. This facility liberates us.’ 49\\nThe officer paused again and took a breath before adding wistfully, ‘But\\ndo you know, ma’am, that all this had come at a great personal cost?

He said, “I am a soldier, I\\nonly want active soldiering. And I need peace to focus on my job. People’s\\nunnecessary speculations trouble me more.”’\\nI also had a word with Lt Gen A.K. Singh (retd), ex-Southern\\nCommander and the former Lieutenant Governor of Andaman and Nicobar\\nIslands and Puducherry. He has known Brig Saurabh Singh Shekhawat for\\nmany years. He told me, ‘Saurabh is a man with true soldierly attributes.\\nHis men would follow him anywhere only because he puts himself in\\nharm’s way first. Anyway, I would want my battlefield subordinates to be\\nlike him. He exhibits excellent abilities and agility during any task. He is\\ndaring and courageous, but at the same time, he is responsible and calm.\\nThis shows how he has found his balance. Tell me, what kind of person\\nwould climb Mount Everest thrice! It is only a man with the utmost\\ndetermination and skill and also a man who is not reckless who would do\\nthis. If you see, in Loktak, he trained for forty-five days along with his men\\n—that kind of patience is rare, I tell you.

Each Army and Navy team had their\\nrespective sets of officers: JCOs and non-commissioned officers, but\\neventually, the Army team, under the capable leadership of Mahendra saab,\\nwon that particular exercise.\\nWhen I asked Mahendra saab about it, he laughed and said, ‘Yes, I\\nremember it happened in 2007. In the water, Navy commandos are better\\nthan us. But when it comes to land warfare—whether it is running through\\nthe jungles, slithering down from helicopters or raiding airports—no one\\ncan beat the Para Special Forces operatives. We are also used to operating\\nin jungles with minimal rations, so it did not deter us when our rations were\\ncut off.’\\nHe continued, chuckling, ‘I remember this particular exercise because\\nthe locals on that island found our activities suspicious and reported us to\\nthe local police!

This is what had\\nhappened in the past—every time the forces had tried to enter a building,\\nthey were faced with a volley of bullets. Tushar then used grenade\\nlaunchers to make holes just beside the windows, so that the snipers had\\nproper visibility for an accurate shot inside the building. He then briefed the\\nteam to make their entry from both sides of the establishment to confuse the\\nterrorists about their exact movements.

During the course of our\\ninteraction she kept on sobbing; her grief knows no bounds. Bal Krishan\\nwas the son she loved the most and she received equal love and respect\\nfrom him. The loss was huge; a mother lost the apple of her eye so that\\nMother India remains.\\nThe quiet, reserved and studious Bal Krishan aspired to become a\\nmedico one day. During his probation period in 4 Para (SF), he had chosen\\nmedicine as his specialized skill. He often made diagrams of the human\\nbody and pasted them on the walls of his room so that they would be the\\nfirst thing he saw when he opened his eyes in the morning. Even though he\\nwas an SF guy, he had great compassion for people.\\nOne of Bal Krishan’s close friends shared with me, ‘Madam, you know,\\nonce, during probation, he came across another probationer who was\\ndrinking water from a nallah. Probationers are often not given water, and to\\nsatiate that kind of thirst, people tend to drink water from anywhere, even\\nthough it is forbidden and a punishable offence. One of the ustads randomly\\nsaw someone drinking water from a distance and called both boys to ask\\nwho was drinking dirty water. Bal Krishan was such a saint that he took all\\nthe blame on himself even though the other chap did not open his mouth\\nonce. Bal Krishan’s sense of integrity saved him, and he was eventually\\nselected for the 4 Para (SF) unit, while the other guy was rejected.’\\nParatrooper Bal Krishan was compassionate, and his endurance levels\\nwere also high. His fellow soldiers remember how during the 100-kilometre\\nspeed march, his legs were bruised entirely, almost broken, and yet he\\nmanaged to finish the march on time without complaining about his pain\\neven once.\\nPerhaps it was this endurance in the quiet and reserved man from the\\nKullu district of Himachal Pradesh that sustained him during his last hours\\nwhen, despite being grievously injured, he was able to pick up his gun and\\nfire at the terrorists.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'calibre (6.4.0) [http://calibre-ebook.com]', 'creator': 'calibre (6.4.0) [http://calibre-ebook.com]', 'creationdate': '2023-07-07T06:03:27+00:00', 'author': 'Swapnil Pandey', 'keywords': 'History, Military, General, Wars & Conflicts, Asia, South, True Crime, Historical, Biography & Autobiography, Special Forces', 'moddate': '2023-07-07T06:03:28+00:00', 'title': \"Balidan: Stories of India's Greatest Para Special Forces Operatives\", 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf_files\\\\Balidan Stories of Indias Greatest Para Special Forces Operatives Book..pdf', 'total_pages': 236, 'page': 210, 'page_label': '211', 'source_file': 'Balidan Stories of Indias Greatest Para Special Forces Operatives Book..pdf', 'file_type': 'pdf'}, page_content='After both the paratroopers fell off the ledge, they were mercilessly fired\\nupon by the terrorists.
